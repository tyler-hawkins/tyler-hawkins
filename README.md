### Hi there, I'm Tyler ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 24 year old aspiring fullstack developer! I have been writing code for several years, and have recently found a big interest in web development! I am fluent in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, and Lua! I am also very experienced with OOP concepts and systems analysis & design, as well as database management using SQL. I have a passion for creating a strong user experience in all my projects. I am always eager to learn new things and explore new technologies!!

### My plans
Learn more and make more cool things!

### What I've been up to
Busy at work! When I'm not at work, I'm improving my fullstack skills.
