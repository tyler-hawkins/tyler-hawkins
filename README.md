### Hi there, I'm Tyler ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22 year old aspiring fullstack developer! I have been writing code for several years, and have recently found a big interest in web development! I am fluent in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, and Lua! I am also very experienced with OOP concepts and systems analysis & design, as well as database management using SQL. I have a passion for creating a strong user experience in all my projects. I am always eager to learn new things and explore new technologies!!

### My plans
Learn more!

### What I've been up to
I am in the middle of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) fullstack JavaScript curriculum. My progress is regularly being posted here on my Github profile. Right now, I'm persistently working on my fullstack skills. My end goal is to create a website where two players can play â™Ÿ chess in the browser!
